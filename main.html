    <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity is a way to measure how fast an algorithm runs.
        An algorithm with lower Time complexity is considered more efficient
        because it takes less time to execute as input size grows.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses.
        In many cases, the Space Complexity can be expressed as O(n), where memory
        usage grows linearly with input size.
